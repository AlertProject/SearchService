    """
    This abstract class represents the different actions performed in
    every commit.
    
    In systems like CVS, where the commit is limited to a single
    file, there will be only one action per commit. However, most of
    the version control systems support atomic commits, where several
    actions are carried out on several files.
    
    Keep in mind that the type of the actions are specific for each
    SCM solution. Though some of them are common such as 'add',
    'delete' or 'modify', others are just available on a
    type of repository, like 'replace' for the SVN solution.
